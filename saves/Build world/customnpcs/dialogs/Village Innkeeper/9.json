But they hold the key to dwell in that particular kind of magic. You might also find some mage towers scattered about the land, particularily those belonging to those weird Veltanni Mages. Nobody has heard of them for a long time, though, and the few people that did come back from them reported they have sadly turned undead. The witches living in those lonely huts aren't keen on teaching strangers their craft, but probably you  might find some of that weird plant-changing dust in their tombs, as their burying rituals order. If you're one of those sick people that practices blood sacrifices, you might find something in the abandoned lairs of those mages, or even the Colliseums.This stuff might be sold by some of the village wizards, if they're still here. I don't remember too much about who lives in the town and who comes here from far.",
