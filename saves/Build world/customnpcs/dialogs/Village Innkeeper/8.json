You could probably find some other useful sthings there, but they are dangerous places. People also say there are some things left in some abandoned factories, but I'd be wary of other scavengers, if I were in you.There are the remains of some shops and markets, and some abandoned laboratories, but other than the rare broken computer  or cable, not much is left there.Not closely related, but there are also some old train stations, where I suppose you could find some rails and stuff, if for whatever reason you might need them, and the broken machines in some farms, including those needed for beekeeping.Most of these things might be on sale from my fellow villagers, but don't count on that too much.",
